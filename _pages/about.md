* I am a second year PhD student in mathematics at [Universite Paris Sorbonne Nord, LAGA](https://www.math.univ-paris13.fr/). 

* My supervisor is [Christian Ausoni](https://www.math.univ-paris13.fr/~ausoni/) and I work on computations of algebraic K-theory and topological cyclic homology of lower chromatic ring spectra.
